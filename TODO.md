# TODO List
* [ ] RegExp scan of tag to add attributes when `ce` is used. (I did this previously in some Codepen)
* [ ] Find out how to use this project in Codepen. (Who wants to bet CORS wil be there to ruin everything?)
* [ ] Can things be less static?
* [ ] Import/Export stuff.
* [ ] Are the `array` and `info` directives overkill?
* [ ] [Semver](https://semver.org/) ALL THE THINGS!
* [ ] [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) ALL THE THINGS!
* [ ] [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ALL THE THINGS!
* [ ] [Get Gud at Git!](https://nic-hartley.github.io/git-gud/) (Try out this simulator. It looks fun.)
* [ ] Should I `use strict`?
* [ ] NPM ALL THE THINGS! (Eventually, I'd like to see this library find its way into Node.js.)
* [ ] Don't be intimidated by VSC's "complexity" thing. (It wouldn't know complex, if it was designed for rocket scientists. Seriously, step off, complexity thingy!)
* [ ] Create a verbose version of `haqs.js` that has the documentation with it and a minified version (`haqs.min.js`) that doesn't. But not too minified.
